# Silicon Memory

> Cognitive memory system for LLM augmentation with temporal awareness, belief tracking, and self-learning entity resolution.

## What This Is

A Python library and server that provides four-layer cognitive memory for AI systems:
- Semantic memory (beliefs as subject-predicate-object triplets with confidence)
- Episodic memory (experiences with outcomes and causal chains)
- Procedural memory (how-to with steps and success tracking)
- Working memory (key-value with TTL)

Built on top: reflection engine (experiences → beliefs), entity resolution (3-pass regex + LLM), salience profiles (context-aware retrieval weighting), graph queries, decision records, GDPR-compliant forgetting.

Storage: SiliconDB (Apple Silicon-native, mmap + WAL, Metal GPU, auto-embedding, graph).

## Python SDK

```python
from silicon_memory import SiliconMemory, RecallContext, Belief, Triplet, Source
from silicon_memory.security.types import UserContext

user = UserContext(user_id="alice", tenant_id="acme")
async with SiliconMemory("/path/to/db", user_context=user) as memory:
    # Store
    await memory.commit_belief(Belief(id=uuid4(), triplet=Triplet("Python", "is", "language"), confidence=0.95, source=Source(id="docs", type="documentation")))
    # Recall
    result = await memory.recall(RecallContext(query="Python", salience_profile="debugging"))
    # Reflect
    from silicon_memory import ReflectionEngine
    engine = ReflectionEngine(memory)
    await engine.reflect()
```

## REST API

19 endpoints at /api/v1. Key ones:

POST /store {content, type?, confidence?} → {id, type, stored}
POST /recall {query, salience_profile?, max_facts?} → {facts[], experiences[], procedures[], working_context}
POST /query {query, limit?} → {beliefs[], count}
POST /ingest {source_type, content} → {experiences_created, entities_resolved}
POST /reflect {max_experiences?} → {patterns_found, new_beliefs}
POST /entities/bootstrap {text} → {detectors_created, extractors_created}
POST /entities/resolve {text} → {resolved[], unresolved[]}
POST /forget {scope, entity_id?} → {deleted_count}
GET /health → {status, version}

## MCP Tools

10 tools for LLM clients: memory_recall, memory_store, memory_get, memory_query, what_do_you_know, working_memory, decision_store, decision_recall, context_switch, forget.

Start MCP server: silicon-memory-server --mode mcp

## Entity Resolution

Three-pass architecture for domain-agnostic entity detection:
1. Detect — broad regex patterns scan full text for candidates (microseconds)
2. Extract — precise regex patterns per candidate determine type and normalize
3. Disambiguate — context embedding comparison when multiple extractors match

Rules are generated offline by LLM from sample documents (bootstrap endpoint). No LLM calls at runtime.

## Key Types

Belief: id, content, triplet (subject/predicate/object), confidence, source, status, tags
Experience: id, content, occurred_at, outcome, session_id, causal_parent
Procedure: id, name, trigger, steps, confidence, success_count/failure_count
RecallContext: query, salience_profile, max_facts, min_confidence
UserContext: user_id, tenant_id (required for all operations)
